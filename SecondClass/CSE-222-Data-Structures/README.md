## Description

In this course, we learned various data structures and algorithms, and this repository contains my implementations of the homework assignments. Each homework solution is organized into separate folders, named `homework1`, `homework2`, and so on.

Within each homework folder, you will find the following:

- `README.md`: A brief description of the homework problem and my approach to solving it.
- Source code files (`.java`) for the implementation of the solution.
- Any necessary input files or test cases.

## Usage

To use these homework solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mens1s/data-structures-cse222.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired homework folder, such as `homework1`:

   ```bash
   cd data-structures-cse222/homework1
   ```

3. Compile the Java source code files using a Java compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   javac Solution.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled bytecode:

   ```bash
   java Solution
   ```

Please note that these solutions are intended to be used as a reference or for educational purposes only. Copying these solutions directly for your own homework assignments would be considered plagiarism, which is not encouraged.
