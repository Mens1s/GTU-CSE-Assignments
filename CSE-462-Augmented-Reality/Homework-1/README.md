# AR Interactive Experience with Car Control, Robot, Multimedia, and Animations - Unity3D

This project showcases an advanced AR experience developed using Unity3D and ARCore. It features car control, robot interactions, multimedia elements (video, text, image), and animations. Users can interact with various AR objects in a dynamic and immersive environment.

## Features

- **Car Control**: Use a virtual joystick to control a car in the AR environment.
- **Robot Interaction**: A robot in the AR scene interacts with the user through animations and dialogue.
- **Video-Text-Image AR Display**: The project supports the display of multimedia elements (videos, text, images) in augmented reality.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for AR objects, including robot movements and car actions.
- **Interactive AR Objects**: Users can interact with objects in the AR scene, making them move, animate, or display multimedia content.

## How It Works

1. **Car Control**: Use the on-screen joystick to navigate the car through the AR environment.
2. **Robot**: The robot provides instructions and guides the user with animations and text dialogue.
3. **Multimedia Display**: AR objects display videos, images, and text when interacted with.
4. **Object Interaction**: Tapping on objects triggers actions like movement or multimedia playback.
5. **Animations**: The robot and car have fluid animations for realistic motion in the AR scene.
